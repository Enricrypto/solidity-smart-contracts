# Solidity Contracts 

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for the Gift Me platform, including `DepositToken`, `Vault`, and `Staking` contracts. These contracts are designed to facilitate token deposits, secure storage in vaults, and staking functionalities.

## Introduction

This repository contains the core Solidity contracts. The `DepositToken` contract handles token deposits, the `Vault` contract provides secure storage, and the `Staking` contract allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards.

## Contracts Overview

### DepositToken
- **Purpose**: Handles the depositing of tokens by users.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `deposit(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit a specified amount of tokens.
  - `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to withdraw a specified amount of their deposited tokens.

### Vault
- **Purpose**: Provides secure storage for tokens.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `store(uint256 amount)`: Stores a specified amount of tokens in the vault.
  - `retrieve(uint256 amount)`: Retrieves a specified amount of tokens from the vault.

### Staking
- **Purpose**: Allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `stake(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to stake a specified amount of tokens.
  - `unstake(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to unstake a specified amount of tokens.
  - `claimRewards()`: Allows users to claim their staking rewards.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Foundry**: Framework for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Solidity-contracts.git
    cd Solidity-contracts.git
    ```

2. **Install Foundry**:
    Follow the instructions to install Foundry from [Foundry's official documentation](https://getfoundry.sh/).

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    forge install
    ```

## Configuration

Ensure you have the necessary configuration for your development environment. This includes having a local Ethereum node or access to a test network for deploying and testing the contracts.

## Usage

### Compile Contracts
Compile the smart contracts using Foundry:
```sh
forge build
```

### Deploy Contracts
Deploy the contracts to your desired network. You can use scripts or manual deployment methods provided by Foundry.

### Interact with Contracts
Use the deployed contract addresses and ABI definitions to interact with the contracts via your preferred method (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js, or directly through Foundry).

## Testing

### Run Tests
Run the provided tests using Foundry to ensure the contracts behave as expected:
```sh
forge test
```

### Test Coverage
Generate test coverage reports to identify untested code areas:
```sh
forge coverage
```

## Contributing

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
