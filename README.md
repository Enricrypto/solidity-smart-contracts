## Introduction

This repository contains the core Solidity contracts for a vault/staking platform. The DepositToken contract handles token deposits, the Vault contract provides secure storage, the Staking contract allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards, and the LiquidityPool contract enables users to provide liquidity and participate in liquidity mining.

Contracts Overview

## DepositToken
Purpose: Handles the depositing of tokens by users.
Key Functions:
deposit(uint256 amount): Allows users to deposit a specified amount of tokens.
withdraw(uint256 amount): Allows users to withdraw a specified amount of their deposited tokens.

## Vault
Purpose: Provides secure storage for tokens.
Key Functions:
store(uint256 amount): Stores a specified amount of tokens in the vault.
retrieve(uint256 amount): Retrieves a specified amount of tokens from the vault.

## Staking
Purpose: Allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards.
Key Functions:
stake(uint256 amount): Allows users to stake a specified amount of tokens.
unstake(uint256 amount): Allows users to unstake a specified amount of tokens.
claimRewards(): Allows users to claim their staking rewards.

## LiquidityPool
Purpose: Enables users to provide liquidity and participate in liquidity mining.
Key Functions:
addLiquidity(uint256 tokenAmount, uint256 ethAmount): Allows users to add liquidity to the pool by providing both tokens and ETH.
removeLiquidity(uint256 liquidity): Allows users to remove their liquidity from the pool.
claimLiquidityRewards(): Allows users to claim rewards earned from providing liquidity.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Foundry**: Framework for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Solidity-contracts.git
    cd contracts-solidity
    ```

2. **Install Foundry**:
    Follow the instructions to install Foundry from [Foundry's official documentation](https://getfoundry.sh/).

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    forge install
    ```

## Configuration

Ensure you have the necessary configuration for your development environment. This includes having a local Ethereum node or access to a test network for deploying and testing the contracts.

## Usage

### Compile Contracts
Compile the smart contracts using Foundry:
```sh
forge build
```

### Deploy Contracts
Deploy the contracts to your desired network. You can use scripts or manual deployment methods provided by Foundry.

### Interact with Contracts
Use the deployed contract addresses and ABI definitions to interact with the contracts via your preferred method (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js, or directly through Foundry).

## Testing

### Run Tests
Run the provided tests using Foundry to ensure the contracts behave as expected:
```sh
forge test
```

### Test Coverage
Generate test coverage reports to identify untested code areas:
```sh
forge coverage
```
